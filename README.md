## Inspiration
__The hundreds of flyers all around the campus.__
We hate having the images of the flyers in our phones which we eventually forget all about. We created this app so that it can easily obtain the date, time, venue and other useful information in a simplified format and automatically add it to our calendars.

## What it does
* Uploads the image of the flyer.
* Obtains the date, time, venue, event name and other information from the image using Google Vision API
* Displays all the flyer content in a simplified format

## How I built it
With code, duh...

And with the help of mentors.

## Challenges I ran into
* Not having enough time to complete the project.
* Getting to know APIs for the first time
* Finding the right API after some trial-and-error
* Having a bug which mentors could not figure out (and neither did we)

## Accomplishments we are proud of
* Actually getting back the text in the image
* Making a responsive website

## What I learned
* The skill to navigate the ton of information in the API page in order to extract the useful stuff.
* Hackathons are fun.

## What's next for Trial devpost
* Correct the Calendar functionality
* Allow the app to capture images from the camera when on a phone
* Store all the images not locally but on a centralized system for everyone to see
* Host the website on our own domain
