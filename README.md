# FlyMas: The Flyyer Management Solution

## Project Description
__The hundreds of flyers all around the campus__ inspired us to make this web app. We hate having the images of the flyers in our phones which we all eventually forget about. We created this app so that it can easily obtain the date, time, venue and other useful information in a simplified format and automatically add it to our calendars. This web app uses Google Vision API to intelligibly extract the relevant information from the flyer, and presents it neatly in the format shown below:

## What it does
* Uploads the image of the flyer.
* Obtains the date, time, venue, event name and other information from the image using Google Vision API
* Displays all the flyer content in a simplified format


## Future Plans
The project is currently in progress! The plans for future integration can be explored in the issues tab.
